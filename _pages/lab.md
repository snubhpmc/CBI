Our lab is dedicated to transforming healthcare through data-driven approaches. Our research embodies true disciplinary convergence, integrating Engineering, Biology, and Medicine. By combining clinical data, genomics, and artificial intelligence, we advance precision medicine and 
improve patient outcomes.


Our primary goal is to support clinicians in molecular diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Our research addresses every stage of the computational pipeline—from initial discovery to clinical translation.

We achieve this by integrating clinical and genomic data to identify disease-associated molecular alterations and discover clinically significant biomarkers. These findings enable us to guide therapeutic selection through target gene-drug associations and to develop practical diagnostic platforms and solutions for real-world clinical use.
