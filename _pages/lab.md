Our lab is dedicated to transforming healthcare through data-driven approaches. Our research embodies true disciplinary convergence, integrating Engineering, Biology, and Medicine. By combining clinical data, genomics, and artificial intelligence, we advance precision medicine and improve patient outcomes.


**Our primary goal** is to support clinicians in molecular diagnosis and treatment decision-making, addressing every stage of the computational pipeline—from initial discovery to clinical translation.

We integrate clinical and genomic data to identify disease-associated molecular alterations and discover clinically significant biomarkers. These findings guide therapeutic selection through target gene-drug associations and inform the development of practical diagnostic platforms for real-world clinical use.
